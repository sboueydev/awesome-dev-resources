## Preprocessors
### HTML Preprocessors
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) ✓ - Clean and whitespace sensitive html preprocessors formerly known as Jade.

## Frameworks
* [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) ✓ - This is a CSS framework by w3 schools. It has several gorgeous example [templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp) which display wonderfully on the my mobile device. 

  *Update: I tested this framework out recently and I disliked the extra markup it added. I have found this with Bootstrap as well so it is not per say the fault of the framework, just personal preference.*

## Wordpress
### Wordpress Frameworks
* [TypeRocket](https://typerocket.com/) ✓ - This is free and it looks really cool. It has a pagebuilder and custom fields. Setup requires Composer. According to the website it's *"like Advanced Custom Fields + Laravel + Magic in WordPress"

  *Update: I have now tested this and it's pretty darn cool.* 
* [Unyson](http://unyson.io/) - Free drag and drop wordpress framework.
* [Gantry](http://gantry.org/) - Free framework. Includes drag and drop capabilities and works with Grav and Joomla as well as Wordpress.
